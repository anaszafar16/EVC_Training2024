This project aims to provide accurate predictions about students' future performance and grades by collecting and analyzing simple information about them, such as age, study hours, and family support, using machine learning techniques. The project allows students to enter their information through a user-friendly interface and obtain personalized predictions about their academic performance.


## Key Features:
- Student Dropout: Analyze student data to identify factors that increase the risk of dropping out, allowing early intervention and support.
- Bullying Detection: Use data patterns to flag potential bullying situations, enabling proactive measures to create a safer learning environment. 
-Salary Prediction: While directly predicting future salary is complex, the model could analyze academic performance trends and other relevant factors to estimate potential earning brackets after graduation.
- GPA Prediction: The model could predict factors likely to influence GPA, such as study habits, attendance patterns, and engagement in extracurricular activities. This provides students with insights that indirectly impact their GPA.



## Benefits:
### For Students:
- Proactive Learning: Gain insights into strengths and weaknesses to tailor study habits and learning strategies.
- Increased Motivation: Personalized predictions can encourage students by highlighting potential for success.
- Early Intervention: Identify the risk of dropping out or struggling and receive targeted support to improve academic standing.
- Career Planning: Understand how academic performance translates to potential career paths and salary ranges.

### For Institutions:
- Improved Retention Rates: Identify at-risk students early and offer tailored support services to reduce dropout rates.
- Targeted Resource Allocation: Optimize resources by allocating them to students who need the most help.
- Personalized Learning Environment: Develop curriculum and teaching approaches based on student needs for a more effective learning experience.
- Safer Schools: Detect potential bullying situations and implement preventative measures to create a safe learning environment.
